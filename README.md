# infiBanChecker 2019 
Easily Check Whether a Steam64 Is GlobalBanned On infiStar.de

If you have any problems open an issue and i will fix it :p

### How to use
    1.You will need a token (infiStar License Key)
    2.Simply add your token to the infiBanChecker.json file then launch infiBanChecker.exe
    3.Once you have launched it, it will prompt you for a steam64ID. Paste the steam64ID into the console and press KEY Enter
    4.Ban state will be displayed back to you in the console, if search was banned it will also display the date that the ban occurred.

Use this token if you don't have one "c5f780defbd28d93df0a93cf640c5602" NOTE: This token is not mine. I found it on mpgh. If infistar blocks it, you will need to get your own. Ask a friend who has one to share theirs.

### Config Example:

Edit your infiBanChecker.json to look like this Note: if its missing simply start infiBanChecker.exe and it will create the default infiBanChecker.json file

```
{
  "infiStarLic": "your infistar token here"
}
```
